## Introduction

Competitive programming is a sport where participants solve algorithmic problems using a computer
programming language under time pressure. It helps improve programming skills, 
provides networking opportunities with other programmers, and can be a fun and rewarding experience. 
It allows programmers to showcase their skills and may even lead to job opportunities in the tech industry.

## Getting Started

### What is Competitive Programming?

Competitive programming is a sport where participants solve algorithmic problems using a computer


programming language under time pressure. It helps improve programming skills, provides networking opportunities with other programmers, and can be a fun and rewarding experience. It allows programmers to showcase their skills and may even lead to job opportunities in the tech industry.
