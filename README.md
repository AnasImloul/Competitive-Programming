An archive for my competitive programming roadmap.


## Introduction

Competitive programming is a type of sport where participants solve algorithmic problems in a set amount of time using a computer programming language. Participants are usually given a set of problems to solve, and they must write code to solve them as quickly and efficiently as possible.

Competitive programming is important for several reasons. First, it helps participants improve their programming skills by challenging them to solve complex problems under time pressure. This can help them become more efficient and effective programmers in their professional lives.

Second, competitive programming provides an opportunity for participants to network and connect with other programmers. They can learn from each other and share tips and tricks for solving problems.

Finally, competitive programming can be a fun and rewarding experience for participants. It allows them to showcase their skills and compete against other talented programmers. This can be a great way to stay motivated and engaged in programming, and can even lead to job opportunities in the tech industry.
